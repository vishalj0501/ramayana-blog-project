When Rama was exiled from his kingdom, he was forced to leave behind everything he had ever known. He had to give up his home, his family, and his wealth. Even his own horses were taken from him.

But despite all of this, Rama never forgot his gratitude for the horses that had served him so faithfully. When he met Guha, the king of the Nishadas, Guha offered Rama a royal reception. He brought sumptuous food, comfortable beds, and articles of worship.

Rama was pleased by Guha's gesture, but he knew that he could not accept these gifts. He had vowed to live a simple life in exile, and he could not bring himself to eat or sleep in luxury.

But Rama did not want to seem ungrateful. So he asked Guha to leave the food for his horses. "These horses are the favorite steads of Maharaja Dasharata," Rama said. "They have served me faithfully, and I would not want them to go hungry."

Guha was touched by Rama's gesture. He knew that Rama was a great king, even in exile. And he knew that Rama's gratitude was a sign of his true greatness.

"Even in the midst of hardship, we should never forget to show gratitude. We should be grateful for the things we have, even if they are small. And we should be grateful for the people who help us, even if they are not human."
