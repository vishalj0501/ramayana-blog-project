Hanuman, the devoted monkey god, was always eager to serve his lord, Rama. One day, Hanuman saw Sita applying sindoor to her forehead. He asked her what it was, and she told him that it was a mark of married women and that it was said to prolong the life of their husbands.

Hanuman was overjoyed. He thought that if a small amount of sindoor on Sita's forehead could prolong Rama's life, then surely covering his entire body in sindoor would make Rama immortal!

Hanuman immediately went to the market and bought all the sindoor he could find. He then returned to the palace and covered himself head to toe in the red powder.

When Rama saw Hanuman, he was amused. He knew that Hanuman's actions were motivated by his pure love for him, and he was touched by his devotion.

Rama told Hanuman that he didn't need to cover himself in the sindoor to prolong his life. He said that Hanuman's love for him was already enough to keep him safe and happy.

Hanuman was relieved to hear this. He knew that he would never be able to repay Rama for his love and kindness, but he was determined to serve him with all his heart.

"Hanuman's story teaches us the importance of love and devotion. Hanuman's love for Rama was so great that he was willing to do anything to protect him, even if it meant covering himself in sindoor. This story shows us that the greatest gift we can give to those we love is our love and devotion."
