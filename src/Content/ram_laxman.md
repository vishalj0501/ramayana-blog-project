When Ravana kidnaps Sita, she throws her jewellery on the ground so that Lord Rama would find it. Rama showed the jewellery to Lakshmana, but Lakshmana did not recognize any of it. However, when Rama showed him Sita's anklet, Lakshmana recognized it immediately.

"Why do you recognize this but not the other jewellery?" Rama asked.

"I have never looked at Mother Sita's face," Lakshmana replied. "I have only looked at her lotus feet. That is why I recognize her anklet."

Lakshmana's words were a reminder of the deep respect he had for Sita. He had never looked at her face because he did not want to be distracted by her beauty. He had only looked at her feet, which were a symbol of her purity and devotion.

"We should always show respect for others, especially those who are more virtuous than us. We should not be distracted by their beauty or their possessions. We should focus on their inner qualities, such as their purity and devotion.

If we can learn to do this, we will be able to live in peace and harmony with others. We will also be able to achieve our full potential as human beings."
