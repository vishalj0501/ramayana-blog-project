When Ravana kidnaps Sita, she throws her jewellery on the ground so that Lord Rama would find it. Rama showed the jewellery to Lakshmana, but Lakshmana did not recognize any of it. However, when Rama showed him Sita's anklet, Lakshmana recognized it immediately.

"Why do you recognize this but not the other jewellery?" Rama asked.

"I have never looked at Mother Sita's face," Lakshmana replied. "I have only looked at her lotus feet. That is why I recognize her anklet."

Lakshmana's words were a reminder of the deep respect he had for Sita. He had never looked at her face because he did not want to be distracted by her beauty. He had only looked at her feet, which were a symbol of her purity and devotion.
