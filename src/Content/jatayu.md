Jatayu was known for his immense strength, bravery, and unwavering loyalty. One day, while flying high above the forest, Jatayu noticed a beautiful princess named Sita being abducted by a fearsome demon king named Ravana.
Driven by his noble heart, Jatayu immediately decided to rescue the princess. He swooped down with great speed, engaging in a fierce baDle with Ravana. Despite his valiant efforts, Jatayu was overpowered by the mighty demon king, and his wings were badly injured.

As Ravana flew away with Sita, Jatayu, determined to fulfill his duty, crawled his way to Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana, who were desperately searching for Sita. Jatayu conveyed the dire situation and informed them of Ravana's direction.
Overwhelmed by Jatayu's sacrifice and bravery, Lord Rama embraced the wounded bird with gratitude and affection. Jatayu breathed his last breath, knowing that he had fulfilled his duty and helped Lord Rama in his mission to rescue Sita.
