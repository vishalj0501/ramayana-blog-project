When Dasharatha was preparing to appoint his eldest son, Rama, as the crown prince, Kaikeyi's maid Manthara filled her heart with jealousy. Manthara poisoned Kaikeyi's mind, manipulating her with cunning words. She convinced Kaikeyi that her own son, Bharata, deserved the throne instead of Rama.

Blinded by ambition and swayed by Manthara's manipulations, Kaikeyi demanded that Dasharatha grant her two boons. First, she asked Dasharatha to exile Rama to the forest for fourteen years. Second, she requested Bharata to be crowned as the king instead.

Despite Dasharatha's deep sorrow and anguish, he reluctantly agreed to fulfill Kaikeyi's demands. 

As Rama departed, Kaikeyi was overcome with remorse and guilt. She realized the consequences of her hasty actions and the pain she had inflicted upon her family. Filled with remorse, she sought forgiveness from her husband, Dasharatha, but it was too late. Dasharatha's heart shattered with grief, and he passed away, unable to bear the separation from his beloved son.
