 Ravana, the king of Lanka, was a powerful demon. He had conquered many kingdoms and had amassed a great deal of wealth. But Ravana was also arrogant. He believed that he was invincible and that no one could defeat him.

One day, Ravana was fighting a battle against Rama, the prince of Ayodhya. Rama was a powerful warrior, and he was slowly but surely defeating Ravana's army. Ravana realized that he was losing the battle, so he decided to seek help from his brother, Bali.

Bali was a powerful demon who ruled the netherworld. He was known for his strength and his wisdom. Ravana knew that Bali would be able to help him defeat Rama.

Ravana travelled to the netherworld and met with Bali. He told Bali about the battle he was fighting against Rama. Bali listened patiently and then said, "Ravana, you are a fool. You are fighting against the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ramacandra. He is not an ordinary mortal. He is the Lord of the universe. You cannot defeat Him."

Ravana was angry. He refused to believe that he could be defeated by anyone. He said, "I am the most powerful demon in the universe. I have never been defeated in battle. I will defeat Rama and I will rule the world."

Bali tried to reason with Ravana, but Ravana would not listen. He left the netherworld and returned to the battlefield.

The battle between Rama and Ravana continued for many days. In the end, Rama was victorious. He killed Ravana and rescued Sita.

Ravana's story is a reminder that arrogance can be a dangerous thing. It can lead us to make foolish decisions that can have disastrous consequences. If we are arrogant, we may not listen to wise advice. We may not see the danger that we are in. And we may ultimately end up destroying ourselves.

"No matter how powerful we may be, we should never be arrogant. We should always be humble and open to advice. We should never underestimate our opponents, especially if they are the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
