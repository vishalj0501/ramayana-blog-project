In the Ramayana, after Ravana was killed, Hanuman went to Ashoka Vana to meet Sita. Sita was overjoyed to hear the news of Rama's victory, and she asked Hanuman if he would like a boon.

Hanuman was full of anger against the rakshasis who had been guarding Sita, and he wanted to kill them. But Sita told him a story about a hunter and a bear that taught him the importance of compassion.

The story goes that a hunter was being chased by a lion. He climbed up a tree to escape, but the lion followed him. The hunter saw a bear sitting in the tree, and he begged the bear to save him.

The bear agreed to help the hunter, but only if the hunter promised not to harm him. The hunter agreed, and the bear helped him down from the tree. The lion was still waiting for the hunter, but the bear stood in front of the hunter and told the lion that he would not harm him.

The lion was angry, but he knew that the bear was stronger than him, so he had to leave. The hunter was grateful to the bear for saving his life, but he was also ashamed of himself. He had promised the bear that he would not harm him, but then he had pushed the bear off the tree.

The bear forgave the hunter, but the hunter knew that he had done wrong. He vowed to never harm anyone again, and he lived the rest of his life in peace.

Sita told Hanuman that this story was a reminder that we should always be compassionate, even to those who have wronged us. We should not let our anger or hatred consume us, and we should always try to understand the other person's perspective.

Hanuman was impressed by Sita's compassion, and he agreed not to kill the rakshasis. He knew that they were simply following the orders of Ravana and that they were not inherently evil.
