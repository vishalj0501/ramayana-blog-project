When Rama established Ram Rajya, all the gods were pleased. They knew that Vishnu had come to earth to fulfill his purpose, and now it was time for him to return to his heavenly abode.

However, there was one problem. Yamaraja, the god of death, could not find a way to take Rama's life. Hanuman, Rama's loyal monkey devotee, guarded his master's life with fierce devotion.

Rama knew that Yamaraja would not give up, so he decided to trick Hanuman. He dropped his ring into a crack in the floor and then asked Hanuman to fetch it.

Hanuman, of course, agreed. He could change his size at will, so he easily squeezed into the crack and followed it down to Patal Loka, the underworld.

When Hanuman arrived in Patal Loka, he was greeted by the king of snakes. The king knew the secret of life and death, and he told Hanuman that he understood why he was there.

"The ring you seek is in a room full of other rings," the king said. "Each ring represents a different cycle of life and death. When Rama drops his ring, a monkey comes to Patal Loka to fetch it. By the time the monkey returns to earth, Rama has already passed away and a new cycle has begun."

Hanuman was stunned. He had never thought about life and death in this way before. But as he looked around the room at the endless rows of rings, he began to understand.

"I see," he said. "So this is the circle of life."

The king nodded. "It is," he said. "And it is a cycle that will continue forever."

Hanuman took a deep breath. He knew that he had to let go of his attachment to Rama. He had to accept that Rama's time on earth was over.

"I understand," he said. "I will return to earth and I will continue to serve Rama in my own way."

The king smiled. "I knew you would understand," he said. "Now, go and find your ring."

Hanuman bowed to the king and then left Patal Loka. He returned to Earth and found the room full of rings. He picked one at random and then returned to Rama.

Rama smiled when he saw Hanuman. He knew that Hanuman had finally understood the circle of life.

"Thank you, Hanuman," he said. "You have served me well."

Hanuman smiled back. "I am honoured to have served you, my lord," he said.

And so, the circle of life continued. Rama passed away, but Hanuman continued to serve him in his own way. And when the time came, Hanuman would also pass away, and another monkey would be born to serve Rama in the next cycle.

"Life is a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. We must accept that death is a natural part of life and that we will all eventually pass away. However, we can still find meaning in life by serving others and by living our lives to the fullest."
